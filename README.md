The neovim config I daily drive. The aim of this repo is to be able to take my config wherever I want and hopefully inspire others to build their own configs.

## Installation 🧰
>It is important to note that the config <mark>only works on UNIX-base systems</mark> and on <mark>neovim</mark> because of the folder structure.

After installing the required dependencies (listed down below), go inside ⚙ `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (most probably your `$HOME/.config` directory). Once inside you just have to clone the repo using: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yoquec/nvim.git
```

Restart neovim, and you will be good to go! 🎉


## Dependencies 🏗
